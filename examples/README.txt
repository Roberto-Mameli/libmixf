-----------
(1) PURPOSE
-----------
This file describes libmixf usage examples and how to compile and use them.


---------------
(2) ASSUMPTIONS
---------------
It is assumed that libraries are correctly installed into /usr/local/lib and that
this path is either configured in /etc/ld.so.conf or in environment variable
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


----------------
(3) INSTRUCTIONS
----------------
The library comes with some example files in the ./examples subdirectory.
To compile a generic example file (let's say Example1.c), simply type:

    gcc -g -c -O2 -Wall -v -I../../headers Example1.c
    gcc -g -o ../bin/Example1 Example1.o -lmixf

(for shared library linking) or:

    gcc  ./Example1.c -I../../headers -L../../lib  -o ../bin/Example1 -lmixf

However, they can be compiled all at once by typing either:

    make static

or

    make shared

Both commands above will produce executables in the ./examples/bin subdirectory;
specifically, the former will produce executables linked statically with the
libmixf library, while the latter will provide executables linked dinamically.

The following command clears all executables:

    make clean


-----------------------------
(4) BRIEF EXAMPLE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------
(1) Example1.c
--------------
Usage:
    ./Example1 <configuration file>
e.g.
    ./Example1 ../conf/Conf_Example1_OK_1.cnf

This example takes one argument, that is the name of a configuration file.
This file shall have the following format:

    $STRINGTOCONVERT = <value of the string without apices>
    $LICENSEFILE = <file name to save encrypted string>

i.e. it shall be composed of two mandatory parameters (respectively a
literal parameter constituted by a clear text string and a filename
parameter). The program parses the configuration file and, if
everything is OK, it provides two different choices. The first
allows to encrypt $STRINGTOCONVERT writing the result into
$LICENSEFILE. The second allows to read $LICENSEFILE, decrypt it and
check that the content is equal to $STRINGTOCONVERT.
Encryption and decryption are based on some host specific parameters,
specifically the hostname and hostid. Therefore the encrypted file
can only be decrypted on the same host on which it was encrypted.
There is also a third option, that forces configuration file reload.

(2) Example2.c
--------------
Usage:
    ./Example2

This source code provides an example of usage of some libmixf functions
related to lock handling and counters handling.
At startup, the program checks if a lock is already present: if so, it
exits (probably another instance is still running), otherwise it sets
a lock that will be released at program termination.
After that, the program enters an infinite loop, in which it expects
input from the keyboard. When a key other than space is pressed, the
program simply update some internal counters. Counters are managed through
counters handling libmixf functions.
The program collects counters with a base interval of 5 minutes (e.g. at
HH:00, HH.05, and so on up to HH:55) and an aggregate interval of 30 minutes
(e.g. at HH:00 and HH:30 of every hour). Base counters are dumped to
"../stats/base" directory, while aggregate counters are dumped to
"../stats/aggr".
Te program collects the following scalar counters:
   1. TotalNumberLowerCaseLetters
   2. TotalNumberUpperCaseLetters
   3. TotalNumberDigits
   4. TotalNumberOtherChars
   5. Plus-MinusHits
They are all PEG ounters, except for the last which is a ROLLER counter
(i.e. it is increased by one when '+' is pressed, decreased by one if '-'
is pressed). For counters 1, 2 and 3, there are also some vector counters
which provide a drill down of, respectively, lowercase letters, uppercase
letters and digits.
Execution terminates when space is pressed.

(3) Example3.c
--------------
Usage:
    ./Example3

This example reads either an e-mail, an URL or an IPv4 address and
validates it; parameters can either be read from the terminal or
from a configuration file. In the latter case parameters in the
file will be named respectively: email, url and ip

(4) Example4.c
--------------
Usage:
    ./Example3
This example performs a loop repeated 30 times. At generic
iteration i, it creates a random token of length i, with
characters that belong to a charset composed by uppercase
letters and digits (0-9)
